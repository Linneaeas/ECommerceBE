* Separated DTO's from Models to a DTO folder.
* Deleted role manager since we dont use it. 
* Created CartService
* One function to retrive the userID
* Fixed CartService and updated CartController accordingly
* Added ProductService and updated CartController accordingly
* CheckoutController only has one endpoint so we keept all logic in the controller. 
* Formatted files, separated long functions/arrow functions etc to multiple lines.  Adjusted spacing to make code more readable.
